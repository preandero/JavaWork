            <h1>The 12 constellations of the Zodiac</h1>
            People have been studying the sky for centuries. Millennia, even. And who can blame them? It’s captivating
            up there! On any given clear night, there are probably more than two thousand stars that can be seen from
            Earth without a telescope. And the thing is, you don’t need fancy and expensive equipment to appreciate the
            shapes and patterns in the sky. It’s right above us for all to enjoy.
            <br><br>
            Even way before the invention of telescopes, ancient astronomers tracked the movement of the objects they
            saw in the sky. They looked out for the stars, the movements of the sun and the moon, as well as comets and
            shooting stars, trying to decipher their behavior and reason to be… Over time, one particular group of
            celestial objects ended up getting a lot of attention. These are the twelve constellations that make up what
            we know as the zodiac.
            <br><br>
            What are the 12 constellations of the zodiac? And what is the zodiac exactly? It is a word which we flaunt
            easily but whose origins many ignore. It’s for this reason that today we’ll delve into the fascinating
            universe of the zodiac.

            <h1 id="1">The Sagittarius constellation</h1>
            At the end and of every year, approximately between November 23 and December 21, the sun passes through the
            Sagittarius constellation. The Greeks called Sagittarius The Archer, because it reminded them of the
            centaur, who was represented by the symbol of a bow and arrow, in their mythology.

            <h1 id="2">The Capricorn constellation</h1>
            The sun transits through the Capricorn constellation in January through February. It’s sometimes called The
            Sea Goat, since the ancient Greeks compared it to a goat with a fish instead of a tail. It is one of the
            four cardinal signs and it traditionally marked the winter solstice. The name Capricorn is a direct heritage
            from the ancient Greeks. As the myth goes, Capricorn was the first hybrid creature created by Hermes, the
            messenger god.

            </a>
            Capricornus is actually the smallest of the 12 zodiac constellations, covers 413.95 square degrees of the
            southern sky.
        </div>
        <div id="contentText">
            <h1 id="3">The Aquarius constellation</h1>
            In February, it’s Aquarius, or the Water Bear, which is on the path of the sun along the ecliptic. This
            constellation is one of the oldest we know, as it was coined by the ancient Babylonians, who thought it
            resembled an old man pouring water from a pitcher. This metaphor meant to them that Aquarius was the bringer
            of rain. It was also a symbol of knowledge and wisdom.

            </a>
            Covering an area of 979.85 square degrees, Aquarius is the second largest zodiac constellation and the tenth
            largest constellation in our sky.

        <div id="contentText">
            <h1 id="4">The Pisces constellation</h1>
            Pisces, or “The Fishes”, becomes prominent in the ecliptic every year in the month of March. The Pisces
            constellation represents the Greco-Roman goddess Venus, or Aphrodite in its Greek name. The myth says the
            goddess turned herself into a fish in order to escape from an evil monster.

            <h1 id="5">The Aries constellation</h1>
            Aries shows up in the month of April. This constellation of the Zodiac is also known as “The Ram”, and is
            one of the four cardinal signs. This is yet another heritage from Greek mythology, in which Aries was a
            legendary ram with wings, and also represented Ares, the god of war. For the ancient Babylonians, however,
            the Aries constellation represented the Spring equinox and was a symbol of fertility.

            The constellation of Taurus reaches its highest point between the months of April and May. Cultures all over
            the world recognize the Taurus constellation as the shape of a bull. It’s named after the Roman god Jupiter,
            or Zeus according to the Greek tradition, who would turn himself into a bull to visit the world of the
            mortals. It also traditionally symbolized the coming of spring and was considered a sign of fertility.

            The constellation most prominent along the ecliptic during the month of June is Gemini, also called “The
            Twins”. Its shape reminded the ancient Greeks of the twin sons of Zeus. In fact, its brightest stars, Castor
            and Pollux, represent the Gemini twins. The most popular story of Gemini tells that the twins partook in
            cattle theft when the Milky Way was made up of a herd of dairy cows.

            The Cancer constellation becomes visible to the naked eye in July. It is also known as “The Crab” because of
            its multiple legs and extremities. According to the ancient Greek legend, the gigantic crab is one of the
            many creatures battled by the hero Heracles (also known as Hercules in the Roman tradition).

            By the end of the month of July, and during most of August, it is the constellation of Leo which lies along
            the path of the sun. For ancient observers, it resembled the shape of a lion. A fun fact about this
            constellations is that ancient Egyptians would recognize the coming of Leo due to the timing of the Nile
            tide.

            <h1 id="11">The Libra constellation</h1>
            The sun passes through Libra between September and October, when the days and nights are roughly equal in

            Contrary to popular belief, the zodiac is much more than an astrological system to predict love, fortune,
            and health, among other things. For millennia, it was a tool used by our ancestors to better understand the
            motions of the sun and the Earth. Not only that, but it encompasses the humble beginnings of astronomy, one
            of the oldest sciences known to mankind It is part of our heritage and, as such, it is worth knowing its
            origin. Stay tuned for more insights on the stars and the secrets they behold!
